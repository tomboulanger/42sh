OPTIONAL SECTION _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
You will get most of your points in this section.
You have free-rein and can do what you want. However, the entire project’s coherence will be taken into
consideration.
Once more, stability will be much more important that quantity. Don’t include an option that will cause a
problem for the rest of the program (especially for the mandatory section!).
For the different commands and compatibility (syntax), the reference shell used will be
tcsh.
Here is a list of desired extras:
• inhibitors (‘\’),
• globbings (‘*’, ‘?’, ‘[’, ’]’),
• job control (‘&’, fg),
• backticks (“’),
• parentheses (‘(’ and ‘)’),
• variables (local and env),
• special variables (term, precmd, cwdcmd, cwd, ignoreof for instance),
• history (‘!’),
• aliases,
• line edition (multiline, dynamic rebinding, auto-completion dynamic,
• scripting (a bit harsh though).
